sq is rational database

to write a useful data we need to have something called schema 
what is schema?
you can think of it is the shape of our data 
---- our data are made of tables and columns 
---- so to design a great schema, we have to consider 
-- 1. what fields and columns the table need
-- 2. what data type for each columns 
-- 3. the restrictions and constrains for each columns

Data Definition Language (DDL)
-----------------------------
CREATE TABLE <table name > (
    <column> ==> <type> <constrains>,
    <column> ==> <type> <constrains>,
)

// this command helps to change the schema of  an existed table
ALERT TABLE <table> <stuff to change>;


DRO TABLE ==> delete the table
