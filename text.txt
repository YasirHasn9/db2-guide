what is data base ?
simply is a collection of data code be written or digital.


there 3 type of database out there but here we are gonna focus on the 
rational database

to deal with it we need something called sql.
sq is rational database

to write a useful data we need to have something called schema 
what is schema?
you can think of it is the shape of our data 
---- our data are made of tables and columns 
---- so to design a great schema, we have to consider 
-- 1. what fields and columns the table need
-- 2. what data type for each columns 
-- 3. the restrictions and constrains for each columns
-------------------------------------------------------



Data Definition Language (DDL)
-----------------------------
CREATE TABLE <table name > (
    <column> ==> <type> <constrains>,
    <column> ==> <type> <constrains>,
)

// this command helps to change the schema of  an existed table
ALERT TABLE <table> <stuff to change>;


DRO TABLE ==> delete the table 

to work with knex instead of the sqlite 
npm install knex

npx knex iniy to create a fire called knexfile
that han an object 
module.exports = {
    client : "sqlite3",
    connection: {
        filename: "the root of the folder to get the file db.3
    },
    useNullAsDefault: true
}


then we create a file called config in the data 
import knex and the knexfile 

module.exports = knex(the path of the knexfile)



---- note that it is not best practice to play with data in the 
raw sqlite because one mistake could cost us alot 

here it comes the benefits of migration

so the knex has a command called knex migrate:make <TableName>
so this will make a folder called migrations 
that has a single file that tilted it as the data 
like : 2022691600_tableName.js
